First thing I did was create a Unity project with the 3d URP stuff

Second was to make sure the packages were installed (here is the tip to do that)
- first, you go to edit and project settings. click 'xr plugin management' and install xr plugin management system
- once it's installed, you can select on the 'windows' and 'android' tab, openxr (let things install/restart if need be), then add the oculus touch controller profile. 
- then, you can add a 'tracked pose driver' to your unity 

we aren't done yet though, next you need to click window -> package manager -> the plus sign -> add package by name

and the name is: com.unity.xr.interaction.toolkit then click install

now remove the main camera and then add an xr origin (VR)

add two game objects under XR origin, name them 'left hand' and 'right hand' then add the "XR Controller" module.

Then you want to click on window and go to package manager, then samples under the xr interaction toolkit, and import the starter assets

so you can now go in the file looker and inspector then click on the xr default left/right controller and drag them into the software itself. 

go back to the left hand/right hand and click on the tiny slider icon on the 'xr controller' script and find xri default left/right controller

click on XR origin and add a new 'input action manager' (if it isn't already there lol)

then add a new action asset under the action asset list, add 'xr default input actions'

press play to test

now select both left hand and right hand, then right click, go to 3d, and select cube. then go to each cube and make the sacle 0.1
